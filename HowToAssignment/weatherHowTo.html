      Retrieving and visualizing historical weather data by zipcode,
      utilizing NCDC (National Climatic Data Center) API V2 and dimple.js
    </h1>
    <p> 
      This walkthrough will deal in detail with utilization of the V2 web services provided by the National Climatic Data Center.
      The NCDC has extensive databases of weather data from around the world for many decades, in some cases over 100 years.
      The web services documentation can be accessed from this link:

      Unfortunately, the documentation is relatively sparse, particularly when it comes to detailing the
      metadata for the numerous datasets, and the permissible field values for the different
      request types available through the service.  Here is a table of all the datasets available from
      the NCDC, either by flat files that can be requested from their web portal,
      or though their web services for integration with other web apps.

      For this walkthrough, we will use the NORMAL_DLY dataset, which contains data on daily
      normal weather in a large variety of fields, based on data from 30 years between 1980 and 2010
      from over 9000 weather stations, mostly in the US.  A good description of the
      weather fields available in this dataset can be found at this link:

      One useful thing a user might like to do is to graph the 30 year normals for the year
      at a selected location.  A nice graphing web API is dimple.js.  This is an extension
      of the powerful but complex d3.js library.  The tools enable visualizations like charts
      and many other things by implementing scalable vector graphics (SVG) in a web app and
      manipulating the graphics based off data and styles you provide.  Information about dimple.js,
      including the split line chart we will adapt for our weather web page, can be found at these links:
    </p>
    <a href="http://dimplejs.org/examples_viewer.html?id=lines_horizontal_stacked">

      https://github.com/PMSI-AlignAlytics/dimple
    </a><br><br>
    <p>
      Using dimple, once your dataset is formatted in an acceptable JSON format (more
      on that later), it takes just 10-20 lines of javascript code to get your
      charts up and running!  Cool eh?
    </p>
    <p>
      One final limitation of the NCDC webservices, and actually their flat file
      retrieval engine, as well, is that the user must request data by a specific
      locationid or stationid.  These locations and stations are not linked to zipcodes
      or cities, and there is no engine to retrieve the nearest station to a zipcode,
      a city, or even latitude and longitude coordinates.  Never fear, we will just
      build a quick engine to do this ourselves, using a simple mySQL database and
      a little web service from geocoder.us, which will allow us to submit a zipcode
      and receive back the latitude and longitude of the centroid of that zipcode's area.

    </a><br><br>
    <h2>1) Build the mySQL Database:</h2>
    <p>
      Before beginning, make sure you have retrieved the allstations.csv file from the
      github repository above, or retrieved the station data you desire in .txt format
      from the NCDC site and processed into a .csv file.  The NCDC link to retrieve
      station data for NORMAL_DLY can be found here:
    </p>
    <a href="ftp://ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/normals/1981-2010/station-inventories/allstations.txt">
      ftp://ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/normals/1981-2010/station-inventories/allstations.txt
    </a><br><br>
    <p>
      For this tutorial, we will be using phpMyAdmin.  From your main database screen, create
      a new database with the number of fields equal to the number of columns in your .csv file,
      plus a unique id field for your primary database key.  If you are using the allstations.csv
      file from the github link for this tutorial, you will add 7 fields.  
    </p>
    <img src="images/create database.jpg" style="width: 800px">
    <p>
      Populate the information for each field.  Make sure your id field is first, set to
      auto_increment, and checked as a primary key, else the .csv import may not work
      correctly.  The setup for the allstations.csv data can be seen in this screenshot:
    </p>
    <img src="images/field metadata.jpg" style="width: 800px">
    <p>
      Now, we will import the data from the .csv file to the mySQL database.  Click the
      Import tab.  Click choose file and navigate to your .csv file.  If you have column
      headers in your file, set the number of records to skip from start equal to 1.  Set
      the format to csv, fields terminated by a comma, fields enclosed by blank, fields
      escaped by backslash, lines terminated by "auto", and column names should be the
      column names in your database, excluding the "id" field, in the order in which they
      occur in your .csv file, the names separated by commas with no spaces.  An example can
      be seen in this screenshot:
    </p>
    <img src="images/import database.jpg" style="width: 800px">
    <p>
      We now have a database!  Take a note of your database name and password, the
      URL to your database, and your table and field names, we will be using those soon.
    </p>
    <h2>2) Build the Basic Search by Zipcode Engine and Interface</h2>
    <p>
      Alright, database is done, let's start actually building the web page.  First, 
      we want to collect a zipcode from the user - process it into a latitude and longitude,
      and retrieve the closest weather station to those coordinates from our database.
      I always start my .php documents by setting display errors to on, php debugging
      can be a pain, but this does help, printing some errors to the actual page.
      I will also include a file called storedInfo.php.  This is a simple file with just
      a few lines of code - in this case one - a php variable $myPassword containing,
      you guessed it, the password to the mySQL database we just created.  This way,
      you can set different permissions to the file with your password that you might
      set to the files with the rest of your web page code.  
    </p>
    <pre><code>
      //php code for start of main php file
      ini_set('display_errors', 'On');
      include 'storedInfo.php'; //for storing password and other secure data
      
      //php code for storedInfo.php
      $myPassword = "youractualpasswordgoeshere";
    </code></pre>
    <p>
      Now, lets create some basic html code to collect a zipcode from a user
      and submit it via a get request.  The code should look something like this,
      just a text input for the zipcode, and a button to submit to the same page via
      the GET method.  Feel free to add some styling by linking a stylesheet, as
      I've done here.  
    </p>
    <img src="images/Initial Html.jpg" style="width: 800px">
    <p>Your base page should look something like this:</p>
    <img src="images/base page.jpg" style="width: 800px">
    <p>
      Now let's write the php code to handle that zipcode we just submitted and
      turn it into latitude and longitude coordinates.  This example also uses
      cURL to handle the data request, since it is from another server/domain.
      You should be able to just follow the format in the following code, but
      more documentation on cURL can be found here:
    </p>
    <a href="http://www.tuxradar.com/practicalphp/15/10/03">
      http://www.tuxradar.com/practicalphp/15/10/03
    </a><br><br>
    <p>
      Notice that we first check if retrieveData was set in the GET request, meaning
      the button was pressed.  We only want this code to run if a zipcode was submitted. 
    </p>
    <img src="images/convert zip code.jpg" style="width: 800px">
    <p>
      Next, we will use a bit of math, the haversine formula, in a mySQL query to find
      the distance between our set of coordinates and the stations in our database.
      To make the search a bit faster, since the haversine formula is a bit nasty, taking
      into to account the irregular curvature of the earth and all that, we will limit our
      search to 0.5 degrees plus and minus our coordinates.  A great document on using
      the haversine formula to search for nearest neighbors based on latitude and longitude
      can be found here: 
    </p>
    <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/2569355/Geo-Distance-Search-with-MySQL">
      http://www.scribd.com/doc/2569355/Geo-Distance-Search-with-MySQL
    </a><br><br>
    <p>
      Here is our code, using mysqli prepared statements and the allstations.csv data structure.
      Since we order by distance, the first result will be the closest station to our
      coordinates, and that is the one that we will use. 
    </p>
    <pre><code>
      $minLat = $lat - 0.5;
      $maxLat = $lat + 0.5;
      $minLong = $long - 0.5;
      $maxLong = $long + 0.5;
      
      if(!($stmt = $myConnection->prepare("SELECT ghcnd, station_name, state, 3956 * 2 * ASIN(SQRT(POWER(SIN((
          ? - lat_dec) * pi() / 180 / 2), 2) + COS(? * pi() / 180) * COS(lat_dec * pi() / 180)
          * POWER(SIN((? - long_dec) * pi() / 180 / 2), 2))) as distance FROM ncdc_normal_dly_stations
          WHERE lat_dec between ? and ? and long_dec between ? and ? ORDER BY distance"))) {

        echo "Prepare failed: (" . $myConnection->errno . ") " . $myConnection->error;
      }
      if(!$stmt->bind_param("ddddddd", $lat, $lat, $long, $minLat, $maxLat, $minLong, $maxLong)) {
        echo "Binding parameters failed: (" . $myConnection->errno . ") " . $myConnection->error;
      }
      if(!$stmt->execute()) {
        echo "Execute failed: (" . $myConnection->errno . ") " . $myConnection->error;
      }
      if(!$stmt->bind_result($ghcnd, $stationName, $state, $distance)){
        echo "Result binding failed: (" . $myConection->errno . ") " . $myConnection->error;
      } else {
        $stmt->fetch();
      }
      $stmt->close();
    </code></pre>
    <h2>3)Get Data From NCDC</h2>
    <p>
      So now we know exactly which station is closest to our zipcode, and we are ready to get
      our data from the NCDC.  First, a little housekeeping.  To request data from the NCDC web service,
      you need to register for a token.  Follow this link, and they will send you a token good for
      1000 request per day to whichever email you provide them.
    </p>
    <a href="http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/token">
      http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/token
    </a>
    <p>
      Once you have your token, let's request some data!  Remember, we are going to make three
      separate requests, one for daily max temperatures, one for daily min temp, and one for
      daily chance of precipitation.  
    </p>
    <p>The basic format for each request is this code, just swap in the appropriate datatypeid:</p>
    <pre><code>
      $curl = curl_init();;
      curl_setopt ($curl, CURLOPT_URL,
        "http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/api/v2/data?datasetid=NORMAL_DLY&stationid=GHCND:{$ghcnd}&datatypeid=DLY-TMAX-NORMAL&startdate=2010-01-01&enddate=2010-12-31&limit=365");
      curl_setopt ($curl, CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER, array("token:SVyCZAPbcpzDMPOohQqfgtnYoffvejDQ"));
      curl_setopt($curl, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, 1);
      $maxTemp = json_decode(curl_exec($curl), true); //associative array format
      curl_close($curl);
    </code></pre>
    <p>
      Notice that we make sure to submit the key that you received from the NCDC in the header
      of your cURL request.  For the URL, notice that the start date is always 2010-01-01.
      The end date can be any date between 2010-01-01 and 2010-12-31.  We limit our results to
      365, since that is the maximum number of days that can be returned anyway, and because
      if we leave this blank the service defaults to only 25 results.  Finally, note that we
      decode the json output from the ncdc into a php associate array, you'll see why next.
    </p>
    <h2>4) Format the NCDC Data for the Dimple Chart</h2>
    <p>
      Dimple takes json data in a very specific format - no nested objects, only a flat
      table with consistent rows and simple types for every key.  Something like this:
    </p>
    <pre></code>
      var myData =  [
        { "Brand":"Coolio", "Region":"Hipsville", "Sales Volume":1000 },
        { "Brand":"Uncoolio", "Region":"Hipsville", "Sales Volume":500 },
        { "Brand":"Coolio", "Region":"Dullsville", "Sales Volume":100 },
        { "Brand":"Uncoolio", "Region":"Dullsville", "Sales Volume":2000 }
        { "Brand":"Coolio", "Region":"Nowhere", "Sales Volume":1500 },
        { "Brand":"Uncoolio", "Region":"Nowhere", "Sales Volume":200 }
      ];
    </code></pre>
    <p>
      So that means we need to get our weather data from the ncdc into this format.
      To make matters a bit more complicated, the ncdc datasets aren't always complete.
      Often, temperature or rain data might be missing for a given station.
      So we will enclose our array building code in some if statements, to only add
      data if it exists.  This code will generate a nice associative array and then
      convert it just the way Dimple likes.  
    </p>
    <pre><code>
      for ($i = 0; $i < 365; $i++) {
        if (!empty($maxTemp)) {
          $weatherArray[] = array('Date'=>$maxTemp['results'][$i]['date'],
             'DataType'=>'MaxTemp', 'Value'=>$maxTemp['results'][$i]['value'] / 10);
        }
        if (!empty($minTemp)) {
          $weatherArray[] = array('Date'=>$minTemp['results'][$i]['date'],
            'DataType'=>'MinTemp', 'Value'=>$minTemp['results'][$i]['value'] / 10);
        }
        if (!empty($chanceRain)) {
          $weatherArray[] = array('Date'=>$chanceRain['results'][$i]['date'],
            'DataType'=>'ChanceRain', 'Value'=>$chanceRain['results'][$i]['value'] / 10);
        }
      }
      
      //create simple JSON array with weather data    
      $weatherJson = json_encode($weatherArray);
    </code></pre>
    <p>The final output will be something like this:</p>
    <pre><code>
      $ weatherJson = [
        {"Date":"2010-01-01", "Datatype":"MaxTemp","Value":36.5},
        {"Date":"2010-01-01", "Datatype":"MinTemp","Value":18.2},
        {"Date":"2010-01-01", "Datatype":"ChanceRain","Value":19.3},
        {"Date":"2010-01-02", "Datatype":"MaxTemp","Value":36.7},
        {"Date":"2010-01-02", "Datatype":"MinTemp","Value":18.1},
        {"Date":"2010-01-02", "Datatype":"ChanceRain","Value":20.1},
        {...}
      ];
    </code></pre>
    <h2>5)  Render the Dimple Chart</h2>
    <p>
      Finally, we are ready to make our chart!  As I promised, this part is almost
      ridiculously simple.  First, we need to include the dimple.js and d3.js libraries
      in our document.  In your html head, add two script tags with the folow src URLs:
    </p>
    <pre><code>
      src="http://d3js.org/d3.v3.min.js"
      src="http://dimplejs.org/dist/dimple.v2.1.0.min.js"
    </code></pre>
    <p>
      Next lets create a div element in our php file and give it a specific id, like
      "weatherChart".  Maybe add a paragraph or header element to give the user some
      feedback on the station name, state, and its distance from their original zipcode.
      Then just a little bit of javascript:
    </p>
    <img src="images/dimple javascript.jpg" style="width: 800px">
    <p>
      Notice that we can echo php and assign it to javascript variables much the same way
      we can echo it directly to the page.  This way we can get all our neat php variables
      from earlier, including the station name, state, and distance from the zipcode, along
      with our nicely formatted data from the NCDC.  Then we create a dimple chart, setting
      it to render in the div that we made.  We add a time axis and assign the Date field
      from our json data to it.  We add a measure axis and assign the Value field from our
      json data to it.  Then, since we want one line for each of our different types of weather
      data, we add a series, set it to the DataType field, and tell it to plot as a line for
      the values of each unique weather type name in the DataType field.  Finally, we add a
      simple legend and draw the chart.  The final product should look something like this:
    </p>
