      Retrieving and visualizing historical weather data by zipcode,
      utilizing NCDC (National Climatic Data Center) API V2 and dimple.js
    </h1>
    <p> 
      This walkthrough will deal in detail with utilization of the V2 web services provided by the National Climatic Data Center.
      The NCDC has extensive databases of weather data from around the world for many decades, in some cases over 100 years.
      The web services documentation can be accessed from this link:

      Unfortunately, the documentation is relatively sparse, particularly when it comes to detailing the
      metadata for the numerous datasets, and the permissible field values for the different
      request types available through the service.  Here is a table of all the datasets available from
      the NCDC, either by flat files that can be requested from their web portal,
      or though their web services for integration with other web apps.

      For this walkthrough, we will use the NORMAL_DLY dataset, which contains data on daily
      normal weather in a large variety of fields, based on data from 30 years between 1980 and 2010
      from over 9000 weather stations, mostly in the US.  A good description of the
      weather fields available in this dataset can be found at this link:

      One useful thing a user might like to do is to graph the 30 year normals for the year
      at a selected location.  A nice graphing web API is dimple.js.  This is an extension
      of the powerful but complex d3.js library.  The tools enable visualizations like charts
      and many other things by implementing scalable vector graphics (SVG) in a web app and
      manipulating the graphics based off data and styles you provide.  Information about dimple.js,
      including the split line chart we will adapt for our weather web page, can be found at these links:
    </p>

    </a><br><br>
    <p>
      Using dimple, once your dataset is formatted in an acceptable JSON format (more
      on that later), it takes just 10-20 lines of javascript code to get your
      charts up and running!  Cool eh?
    </p>

      One final limitation of the NCDC webservices, and actually their flat file
      retrieval engine, as well, is that the user must request data by a specific
      locationid or stationid.  These locations and stations are not linked to zipcodes
      or cities, and there is no engine to retrieve the nearest station to a zipcode,
      a city, or even latitude and longitude coordinates.  Never fear, we will just
      build a quick engine to do this ourselves, using a simple mySQL database and
      a little web service from geocoder.us, which will allow us to submit a zipcode
      and receive back the latitude and longitude of the centroid of that zipcode's area.

    <h2>1) Build the mySQL Database:</h2>
    <p>
      Before beginning, make sure you have retrieved the allstations.csv file from the
      github repository above, or retrieved the station data you desire in .txt format
      from the NCDC site and processed into a .csv file.  The NCDC link to retrieve
      station data for NORMAL_DLY can be found here:
    </p>
    <a href="ftp://ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/normals/1981-2010/station-inventories/allstations.txt">
      ftp://ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/normals/1981-2010/station-inventories/allstations.txt
    </a><br><br>
    <p>
      For this tutorial, we will be using phpMyAdmin.  From your main database screen, create
      a new database with the number of fields equal to the number of columns in your .csv file,
      plus a unique id field for your primary database key.  If you are using the allstations.csv
      file from the github link for this tutorial, you will add 7 fields.  
    </p>
    <img src="images/create database.jpg">
    <p>
      Populate the information for each field.  Make sure your id field is first, set to
      auto_increment, and checked as a primary key, else the .csv import may not work
      correctly.  The setup for the allstations.csv data can be seen in this screenshot:
    </p>
    <div>
      <img src="images/field metadata.jpg">
    </div>
    <p>
      Now, we will import the data from the .csv file to the mySQL database.  Click the
      Import tab.  Click choose file and navigate to your .csv file.  If you have column
      headers in your file, set the number of records to skip from start equal to 1.  Set
      the format to csv, fields terminated by a comma, fields enclosed by blank, fields
      escaped by backslash, lines terminated by "auto", and column names should be the
      column names in your database, excluding the "id" field, in the order in which they
      occur in your .csv file, the names separated by commas with no spaces.  An example can
      be seen in this screenshot:
    </p>
    <div>
      <img src="images/import database.jpg">
    </div>
    <p>
      We now have a database!  Take a note of your database name and password, the
      URL to your database, and your table and field names, we will be using those soon.
